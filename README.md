# Education Faculty Mobile App


Hello I'm Emrah Fidan 👋 

In my first internship, you will see the education practice I have done for my university's education faculty. The application was created using the flutter framework in the dart language.

The purpose of the application is to watch the video and mark the correct answer, such as competition programs. I designed an application like VoScreen.
