This project includes my first mobile application experience that I developed during my first internship experience for my university's faculty of education.

The aim of this project is that we have made a tool to help educate individuals with learning difficulties through a mobile application developed for the students of my university's faculty of education. Below you can find the main objectives of the project:

- Coping with Learning Difficulties: The application makes learning easier for individuals with learning difficulties thanks to entertaining and short, educational videos.

- Competition Style Education: The app provides students with the opportunity to consolidate and assimilate their knowledge through educational competitions and interactive learning activities.

- Tracking Student Progress: The app aims to track student progress and support their development with personalized feedback.

- Gamification: Gamification principles were used in the design and setup of the algorithm to personalize the user experience and reach more people. 

- Faculty of Education Collaboration: In collaboration with teachers and experts from the faculty of education, the app's educational content is continuously updated and improved.



<h2 style="color: #ffa500;"> Features </h1>

Some of the key features of this project include the following:

- Flutter: This app is developed using the Flutter framework, so it works seamlessly on both iOS and Android platforms. It can also be run on the web using the same code base. This increases the usability of the app on multiple platforms and makes the development process more efficient.
- Clean Code: The project is developed using a clean and organized code base, making maintenance and development easier.
- Responsive: The app is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, so users get a great experience on any device.
- Figma Design: The design of the app was created in Figma and you can access the design file [from this link](https://www.figma.com/file/jl62wanA1RBOmlHB12RpAi/Intern?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=uY4VtOwxKemZjn4M-1). This design provides detailed information on how the user interface of the app should look like and guides the development process.

<h2 style="color: #ffa500;">Additions</h2>

Only the design phase of the project has been completed. Background processing will be completed later. The file "deficiencies.txt" contains the project's deficiencies.

<h2>Lessons learned</h1>

Responsive design is really hard for mobile applications. Because there are so many variations in screen size, it is very difficult to make the areas I have specifically designed responsive. 
I also tried to add a light theme - dark theme in my first project attempt, but I gave up because it turned my code into spaghetti code.
